- 👋 Hi, I’m @FearlessCloud01
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, unusual things, linguistic languages, cute things, reading and lazying around.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, C++, C#, CSS, Go, HTML, Java, Javascript, Kotlin, Python, Rust, Swift... or that's the plan currently at the very least...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing atm. I mean, I'm new to this stuff and just messing around right now.
- 📫 How to reach me: FearlessCloud01 on Discord (#9708), Epic Games, Reddit, Twitch, Xbox and Youtube. (And Github ofc) Also, there's my email too...
